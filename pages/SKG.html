        <h3>Firstly, regarding The Crew.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The game had already ran for about 10 years when the plugs were cut (the game was released in 2014, mind you)</li>
            <li>
                Player numbers (on steam specifically) dropped from ~1k to ~300 (and gradually waned therefrom) in just two months
                after The Crew 2 was released on the 29th of June 2018 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/241560/charts/#max">(source)</a>
                so it was probably starting to lose them money to keep the game running.
            </li>
            <li>
                They released <a href="https://archive.ph/20240120062339/https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/the-crew-2/news-updates/mOR3tviszkxfeQCUKxhOV/an-update-on-the-crew">a statement</a>
                on the 14th of December 2023, saying that all editions of the game and its virtual currencies were delisted from
                all storefronts on that day, and that the game's servers would be shut down on the 31st of March 2024,
                saying that "<em>(it had) become a necessity due to upcoming server infrastructure and licensing constraints</em>".
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The keywords there are '<strong>licensing constraints</strong>'. Every car in the game was modeled after a real-world counterpart,
                    so they most likely had 9~10 year contracts with SEVERAL real-life car manufacturers,
                    after which Ubisoft would be firmly on the hook for a <em><strong>fuckton</strong></em> of lawsuits from said manufacturers,
                    if Ubisoft continued to allow the game to be played.</li>
                <li>
                    Saying they want a single-player offline version to continue playing on is effectively like asking Ubisoft
                    "Hey, can you ask those manufacturers if they'll extend their contracts until the heat death of the universe?"
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <em><strong>Yes</strong></em>, it's understandably a huge bummer when games come to the end of its lifespan due to licensing constraints,
            but that's just how the concept of licensing IP to another party works, with most bigger (and arguably less benevolent) entities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em><strong>Yes</strong></em>, it would be better in future if devs/publishers made it clear on exactly how long they have a license to use a given third-party IP,
            but even that gets ugly when you bring factors like competing businesses/studios into the mix.

        <h3>Secondly, regarding the nature of content ownership</h3>
        <p>
            You don't own your games. You buy a license to access the game, that can be revoked at any time for any reason,
            which <em>does</em> include (but is not limited to) reasons like:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The game has shut down for whatever reason such as: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Licensing issues (as aforementioned)</li>
                        <li>The developer/publisher is going bust</li>
                        <li>
                            Something about the game has broken the law of the developer's home country,
                            or ToS of whatever platform the game is offered through.
                        </li>
                        <li>The cost of keeping the game alive has outweighed the profits </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The game becomes inaccessible in your region (e.g. the whole fiasco with Helldivers 2 and Sony).
                </li>
                <li>
                    You've been a dick and gotten yourself banned from the game for whatever reason (cheating, toxicity, scamming, etc).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            And this isn't unique to just games either, nor the end users. 
            It's how it works for basically every platform or entity that distributes creative works, whether that be
            <ul>
                <li>TV/Film Streaming platforms (Disney+, Netflix, Paramount+, iPlayer, etc)</li>
                <li>Music streaming platforms (yes, even Bandcamp)</li>
                <li>Digital AND physical libraries</li>
                <li>Another company that owns the rights to a given piece of Intellectual Property</li>
            </ul>
            Whether you're a developer wanting to use copyrighted music, a writer for a TV show wanting to use a trademarked character, or an end user wanting to play a game, you obtain a license to access the content, and that license can be revoked for any reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            So go ahead, try translating "I bought the game, I should always be able to play it" to anything else, I dare ya.
