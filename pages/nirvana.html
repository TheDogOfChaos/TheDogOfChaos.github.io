            On the topic of Nirvana

        <h3 id="">Let me get this straight.</h3>
        <p>
            I'm not against the mod itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Youtube and Twitch both have stipulations about what kinda things are okay on their platforms, and drug
            usage is a bit of a grey-to-black area. More specifically...
        </p>
        <h4>
            Twitch
        </h4>
        <p>
            At the very minimum, <a
                href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/content-classification-labels?language=en_US#descriptions">
                streams need to be labelled as "Drugs, Intoxication, or Excessive Tobacco Use"
            </a> if they contain use of Marijuana <strong>in any form</strong>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Youtube
        </h4>
        <p>
            Youtube's views on Marijuana is a little more unclear, and I haven't been able to find out exactly their
            policies on Marijuana specifically. Still, I wouldn't count on it being allowed at all though, if not Age
            Restrictable or Demonitizable.
        </p>
        <h4>ALTHOUGH:</h4>
        <p>
            In-game/Non-realistic depictions are <em>probably</em> fine, <strong>though don't quote me on it</strong>,
            because presenting things in a way that could encourage real-life imitation (regardless of if it's done IRL
            or not) is where shit gets bad.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3 id="apology">And now, an apology.</h3>
        <p>
            Red. Surplus. Roxy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm sorry.
            <strong>I just didn't want y'all to put your channels at risk, and I acted impulsively on that.</strong>
            I shoulda just straight-up said I wasn't okay with Nirvana being added.
